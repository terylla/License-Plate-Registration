# License Plate Registration
This project allows user to let the Server automatically assign a license plate number to the car the Client sends to the Server.
  --> The Server then sends back the updated car information immediately after registration.
  --> The updated car information will be displayed on Client's side.
  --> User has the option to quit the client, as well as to skip a registration.
