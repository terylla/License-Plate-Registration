This program allows user to let the Server automatically assign a license plate number to the car the Client sends to the Server.
  <br>--> The Client serialize the a car's information then sends it to the server for registration.
  <br>--> The Server then sends back the updated car information immediately after registration.
  <br>--> The updated car information will be displayed on Client's side.
  <br>--> User has the option to quit the client, as well as to skip a registration.
